So, just to remind you, a vector is a quantity that has both a direction and a magnitude of length. So -- So, concretely the way you draw a vector is by some arrow, like that, OK? And so, it has a length, and it's pointing in some direction. And, so, now, the way that we compute things with vectors, typically, as we introduce a coordinate system. So, if we are in the plane, x-y-axis, if we are in space, x-y-z axis. So, usually I will try to draw my x-y-z axis consistently to look like this. And then, I can represent my vector in terms of its components along the coordinate axis. So, that means when I have this row, I can ask, how much does it go in the x direction? How much does it go in the y direction? How much does it go in the z direction? And, so, let's call this a vector A. So, it's more convention. When we have a vector quantity, we put an arrow on top to remind us that it's a vector. If it's in the textbook, then sometimes it's in bold because it's easier to typeset. If you've tried in your favorite word processor, bold is easy and vectors are not easy. So, the vector you can try to decompose terms of unit vectors directed along the coordinate axis. So, the convention is there is a vector that we call ***amp***lt;i***amp***gt; hat that points along the x axis and has length one. There's a vector called ***amp***lt;j***amp***gt; hat that does the same along the y axis, and the ***amp***lt;k***amp***gt; hat that does the same along the z axis. And, so, we can express any vector in terms of its components. So, the other notation is ***amp***lt;a1, a2, a3 ***amp***gt; between these square brackets. Well, in angular brackets. So, the length of a vector we denote by, if you want, it's the same notation as the absolute value. So, that's going to be a number, as we say, now, a scalar quantity. OK, so, a scalar quantity is a usual numerical quantity as opposed to a vector quantity. And, its direction is sometimes called dir A, and that can be obtained just by scaling the vector down to unit length, for example, by dividing it by its length. So -- Well, there's a lot of notation to be learned. So, for example, if I have two points, P and Q, then I can draw a vector from P to Q. And, that vector is called vector PQ, OK? So, maybe we'll call it A. But, a vector doesn't really have, necessarily, a starting point and an ending point. OK, so if I decide to start here and I go by the same distance in the same direction, this is also vector A. It's the same thing. So, a lot of vectors we'll draw starting at the origin, but we don't have to. So, let's just check and see how things went in recitation. So, let's say that I give you the vector ***amp***lt;3,2,1***amp***gt;. And so, what do you think about the length of this vector? OK, I see an answer forming. So, a lot of you are answering the same thing. Maybe it shouldn't spoil it for those who haven't given it yet. OK, I think the overwhelming vote is in favor of answer number two. I see some sixes, I don't know. That's a perfectly good answer, too, but hopefully in a few minutes it won't be I don't know anymore. So, let's see. How do we find -- -- the length of a vector three, two, one? Well, so, this vector, A, it comes towards us along the x axis by three units. It goes to the right along the y axis by two units, and then it goes up by one unit along the z axis. OK, so, it's pointing towards here. That's pretty hard to draw. So, how do we get its length? Well, maybe we can start with something easier, the length of the vector in the plane. So, observe that A is obtained from a vector, B, in the plane. Say, B equals three (i) hat plus two (j) hat. And then, we just have to, still, go up by one unit, OK? So, let me try to draw a picture in this vertical plane that contains A and B. If I draw it in the vertical plane, so, that's the Z axis, that's not any particular axis, then my vector B will go here, and my vector A will go above it. And here, that's one unit. And, here I have a right angle. So, I can use the Pythagorean theorem to find that length A^2 equals length B^2 plus one. Now, we are reduced to finding the length of B. The length of B, we can again find using the Pythagorean theorem in the XY plane because here we have the right angle. Here we have three units, and here we have two units. OK, so, if you do the calculations, you will see that, well, length of B is square root of (3^2 2^2), that's 13. So, the square root of 13 -- -- and length of A is square root of length B^2 plus one (square it if you want) which is going to be square root of 13 plus one is the square root of 14, hence, answer number two which almost all of you gave. OK, so the general formula, if you follow it with it, in general if we have a vector with components a1, a2, a3, then the length of A is the square root of a1^2 plus a2^2 plus a3^2. OK, any questions about that? Yes? Yes. So, in general, we indeed can consider vectors in abstract spaces that have any number of coordinates. And that you have more components. In this class, we'll mostly see vectors with two or three components because they are easier to draw, and because a lot of the math that we'll see works exactly the same way whether you have three variables or a million variables. If we had a factor with more components, then we would have a lot of trouble drawing it. But we could still define its length in the same way, by summing the squares of the components. So, I'm sorry to say that here, multi-variable, multi will mean mostly two or three.
